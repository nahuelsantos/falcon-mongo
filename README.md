#### Troubleshooting

##### Solving standard_init_linux error
If you run this in a Windows environment and you get this error:
```sh
standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused "no such file or directory"
```
you may need to set up your git to run the follwing script in order to avoid git to rewrite the End of Lines in the files.
```sh
git config core.eol lf
git config core.autocrlf input
```

Or you can set it up globally 
```sh
git config --global core.eol lf
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

##### If you get an error while trying to start the backend container like:
```sh
ERROR: for backend  Cannot create container for service backend: status code not OK but 500: {"Message":"Unhandled exception: Drive has not been shared"}
```
If you are in Windows, you need to enable file sharing between your host and the container by going right click in Docker's icon in system tray and Settings > Resources > File Sharing
